        <p>
            Cats can help you in many ways! They can make you feel less lonely at home if you aren't living with someone else,
            if you get two they can play with each other, and having a cat has many health benefits as well!

            If you would like to get a cat, you can adopt a cat at a local animal shelter, or at a pet store (but you should try an animal shelter first!)
